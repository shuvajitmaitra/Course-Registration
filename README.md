# **3 Project feature that i use in this project**
## 1. Selected course list: 
At first if we click the select button then we have to see in the right side of the web page a list of selected items. There we can see which **Course Name** we are selected. Also we can see it in a list of numbers therefore we simply notice how many course we are added.

## 2. Total credit hour: 
This is another project feature of mine that will show us how many hours of courses we have taken. When we click on the select button, we will see the course name as well as the duration of the course. If we click another button, another course will be added to the list and the duration of the new course will be added to the old course.
## 3. Total remaining hour:
In this feature, I set maximum credit hour is 20 when anyone select any course then  it's shows how many hours are remaining
